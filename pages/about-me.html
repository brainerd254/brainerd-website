        <h2>Who am I</h2>
        <p>Hello, and welcome all. My name is Brainerd Murithi Muthamia. I was born and raise in Meru till I was 15years old after which my parents relocated to Nairobi due to work related issues. I started schooling at the age of 3, and for three years I did my pre-primary level.There after I joined Lower primary classes for another 4 years after which I enrolled for upper primary classes for another 4 years. After that is when I joined high school for another 4 years. The year 2014 is when I completed my high school education and the year after joined Cooperative University and did a diploma in IT which took one and a half years. I decided to look for jobs related to the course I had done but still I didnt meet the qualifications, so after a year of searching what else to do I decided to join St. Paul's University for a degree in Computer Science.</p>
